## Setup

[X] T001. Initialize backend project structure [backend/]
- Create `backend/` with FastAPI app skeleton: `backend/src/app.py`, `backend/src/api/`, `backend/src/models/`, `backend/src/services/`, `backend/tests/`.
- Add `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` with fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, httpx, pytest.
- Ensure Windows-friendly settings; no external network.
- Output: runnable dev server on 127.0.0.1:8733.

[X] T002. Add SQLite initialization with WAL and data path resolution
- Implement utility to resolve DB path preferring `C:\\RegistryApp\\data\\app.db` with cwd fallback and directory creation.
- Ensure `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` at connection.
- Output: module `backend/src/services/db.py` with get_connection() and init_db().

[X] T003. Define DDL for core tables [P]
- Create SQL/ORM setup for Registration, NumberingSequence, AuditEvent, ArchiveBatch based on data-model.md.
- Output: `backend/src/models/schema.sql` or ORM models; executed during startup.

[X] T007. Contract test: GET /registrations [P]
- Created in `backend/tests/contract/test_contract_registrations.py` asserting 200 and page size semantics.
